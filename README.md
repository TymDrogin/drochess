# Rusty Chess Engine

Rusty Chess Engine is a simple chess engine I am working on in my free time.
So far not many things are implemented, howewer the journey is quite enjoyable. The enums and states are pretty neat 
features of rust that helped me get rid of bugs before i even got to run a code. 

## Features

- **Game States**: Full implementation of game states.
- **FEN Processor**: Parse and process FEN strings to initialize the board state.
- **Board Display**: Nicely formatted board display in the console.
